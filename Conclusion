Project Conclusion: MovieStream – A Netflix Doppleganger
In this project, we built a simple, command-line movie streaming application inspired by Netflix, using Java.
The app allows users to view a list of movies, search for movies by title, and view details such as genre, release year, and a brief description.
Although it's a basic prototype, it demonstrates key programming concepts that are fundamental to building interactive applications.

Key Takeaways:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
We implemented classes like Movie and MovieStream to organize and manage the application’s functionality. 
This reinforced my understanding of encapsulation, constructors, and methods.
Data Management:
We used an ArrayList to store the movie data, allowing users to interact with a dynamic list of movies.
While this is hardcoded for simplicity, it also highlighted the concept of storing and managing collections of objects.
User Interaction:
The project involved creating a simple user interface using the console. 
We handled user input and output, allowing users to choose options, search for movies, and view details—all vital skills for developing user-friendly applications.
File Management & Persistence (Future Work):
Currently, movie data is hardcoded, but one potential extension of this project could involve saving and loading movie data from a file or a database, enabling persistence
between app sessions.
